* Trees 
    1. What is a tree. 
        a. A data structure that consists of nodes in a parent/ child relationship.
    2. Tree Terminology 
        a. root: the top node in a tree; 
        b. leaf: a node with no children
    3. Applications for trees
        a. HTML DOM 
        b. Network Routing
        c. Artificial Intelligence

* Binary Tree
    1. A parent can only have 2 children

* Binary Search Trees (BST)
    1. Every Parent node has 2 children;
    2. Every node to the left of a parent node is always less than the parent.
    3. Every node to the right of a parent node is always greater than the parent.

* BST Big O
    1. Average Case (even BST)
        a. insertion - O(log n);
        b. searching - O(log n);
    2. Worst Case (one sided BST)
        a. insertion - O(n);
        b. searching - o(n);# BinarySearchTrees
